# sparql-clustering
Clustering of SPARQL queries starting from [Linked SPARQL Queries (LSQ)](http://lsq.aksw.org/) data.

The method is described in a paper available [in the proceedings of ISWC 2023](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-47240-4_11) and in extended pre-print version [on figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.23751243).

The results of the application on LSQ 2.0 are available also [on figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.23751138) in CSV and RDF formats.

The presentation to ISWC 2023 is available [here](https://github.com/miguel76/sparql-clustering/raw/main/docs/ISWC2023_Presentation.pptx).
